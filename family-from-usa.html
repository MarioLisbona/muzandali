                Hi, Family! You're travelling an awful long way to be here, so hopefully this info helps make your travels run smoothly.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">FLYING TO BALI</h2>
            <p class="info-left-side">
                Fly to Ngurah Rai International Airport (aka Denpasar International). Airport code: <strong>DPS</strong>
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">ENTERING BALI</h2>
            <p class="info-left-side">
                As of January 2022, Bali is open to tourists, with some restrictions. 
                <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Indonesia.html">Here</a>  is the DOS information page for Indonesia.
            </p>
            <p class="info-left-side">
                You do not need to get a visa before you fly to Bali. As long as you're staying fewer than 30 days, you will be given an "on-arrival" Tourist visa when you go through Immigration at DPS. 
                It will cost you IRD 500,000 (USD $35). You'll need rupiah in cash to pay this.
            </p>
            <p class="info-left-side">
                Make sure your passport has at least 6 months validity past your arrival date.
            </p>
            <h2 class="title">VACCINATION AND COVID-19</h2>
            <p class="info-left-side">
                You must be twice vaccinated to enter Bali. You'll need to provide proof of vaccination to Indonesian 
                immigration, as well as proof of travel insurance covering COVID-19-related care.
            </p>
            <p class="info-left-side">
                <a href="https://id.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/">Here</a> is the U.S. Embassy page on Indonesian COVID-19 restrictions.
                <br>
                <a href="https://kemlu.go.id/losangeles/en/news/11727/update-indonesia-travel-restrictions">Here</a> is the Indonesian Consulate General COVID-19 info page.
            </p>
            <p class="info-left-side">
                You <i>may</i> need to <a href="https://vaksinln.dto.kemkes.go.id/sign/in">register your vaccination status</a> to show as proof when you visit Bali venues. 
                We expect this requirement will go away by next year. Watch this space.

            <h2 class="title">GOING FROM THE AIRPORT TO USA</h2>
            <p class="info-left-side">
                <strong>USV Shuttle</strong>: USV offers us a free shuttle to and from the airport. If you're staying at USV, message us and we'll help organise this with you.
            </p>
            <p class="info-left-side">
                <strong>Public taxis</strong>: Uber/Lyft are not available in Bali. You can organise a cab from a transport company within the airport, or 
                just walk outside and catch a cab from the taxi rank. Some drivers might ask you how much you'll pay up front. 
                Don't agree to any amount, insist on using the meter. If the driver doesn't want to use the meter, just find another cab. 
                It will take you about 35-45 mins to get to USV, depending on traffic.
            </p>
            <p class="info-left-side">
                <strong>Cost</strong>: You can expect to pay about IRD 140,000 - 220,000 (USD $10-15) for the 22km ride from the airport to USV. 
                <a href="#">Here</a> are the standard rates.
            </p>
            <p class="info-left-side">

            </p>
            <p class="info-left-side">
                Staying at USV means you'll have to share a villa with other guests. If this isn't your style, or you'd prefer more 
                room or privacy, there are some other accommodation options nearby.
            </p>

            <h2 class="title">GETTING AROUND ULUWATU</h2>
            <p class="info-left-side">
                <strong>Scooter</strong>: The quickest and easiest way to get around in Bali is by renting a scooter. You can usually rent a 
                scooter directly from your hotel, or you can rent them from convenience stores, auto shops, etc. We'll help you 
                out once we get to Bali.
            </p>
            <p class="info-left-side">
                <strong>Taxi</strong>: You can call a taxi (or have your hotel order one for you) whenever you need to go somewhere.
            </p>
            <p class="info-left-side">
                <strong>Private driver</strong>: If you're worried about public taxies, we have a driver friend in Bali who can shuttle you around 
                for a normal taxi price. Just message him on WhatsApp and he'll pick you up at an agreed time. Message us and we can 
                introduce you.
